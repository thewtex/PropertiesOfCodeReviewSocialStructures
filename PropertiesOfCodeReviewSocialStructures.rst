Robustness and Information Transmission Properties of Code Review Social Structures
====================================================================================

Introduction
------------

Code review is a practice that facilitates the rapid collaboration, sharing of
knowledge, and supreme quality typical in open source projects. The code
review social structure is a defining characteristic of a project.  What is
the best social structure for an open source project? In this article, we
examine this question by analyzing three common models, the benevolent dictor
for life (BFDL), hierarchy, and community models with two graph theory metrics
that quantify their robustness and information transmission capabilities.
